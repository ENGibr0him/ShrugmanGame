### main.js

The `main.js` file handles the game flow, including:

- Importing necessary packages (`inquirer`, `chalk`, `figlet`).
- Displaying the ASCII art title using `figlet`.
- Interactively prompting the user to select a category and guess letters using `inquirer`.
- Displaying game messages in color using `chalk`.
- Keeping track of game history.

#### Key Functions:

- `clearConsole()`: Clears the console.
- `displayTitle()`: Displays the ASCII art title using `figlet`.
- `selectCategory()`: Prompts the user to select a category.
- `playGame(category)`: Runs the game loop for the selected category.
- `main()`: Main function that controls the overall game flow.

### game.js

The `game.js` file contains the `ShrugmanGame` class, which is responsible for:

- Initializing the game with a secret phrase.
- Managing game state (correct guesses, incorrect guesses, remaining attempts).
- Providing methods to make guesses, check game status, and get the current state of the game.

### categories.js

The `categories.js` file defines the available categories and their respective phrases. It exports an object where keys are category names and values are arrays of phrases.

// Example content of categories.js
export default {
  movies: ["Brave Heart", "The Godfather", "Inception"],
